        This work began in December of 2023, when I had to schedule the removal of my wisdom teeth at the poor people clinic. They prefaced that the surgery would be done without anesthesia or laughy gas. It would be me, a good amount of numbing shots, and a doctor using brute force to remove my fully grown teeth. I talked to some classmates and joked that I was going to make it a performance piece, they laughed and imagined seeing it as a Live Story on Instagram. I sat on it and wrote. 
        And wrote a lot. 
        Ideas of mother/daughter relationships came up, by means of jealousy, vanity. Ideas of violent cosmetics came up, I wanted to emphasize that a lot of the beauty regimens women are upheld to, call for violent, intrusive procedures; beauty is pain. Notions of "intimacy" and the relationship of patient and dentist came up. Ideal versus Real, inner dialogs and outter stresses, psychological terror. Teeth became a very rich topic to think about.
        Ultimately, this project has become a declaration of helplessness, and then navigating how to gain control.
