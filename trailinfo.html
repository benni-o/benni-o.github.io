        yo how's it hanging
    </h1>
    <p>
        I am currently finishing my last few months of my undergrad degree, at an alternative liberl arts college... with a focus on fine arts and child wellness. It's a little up in the air as to how I will apply this degree. But alas, we persevere. My work so far has been focused on Adolescence, a period in which we have all felt helpess, awkward and confused. I personally believe that we cycle through the phases of early childhood and adolescence for our entire life, and maybe if I understand these phases thoroughly enough I won't have to feel so helpless, awkward and confused going forward. So if you take that trail, you will find in-depth documentations to all the work I've done at The Evergreen State College.
        When I'm not contemplating child/human development, media, and the attention economy, I am probably watching video essays or crafty tutorials on YouTube, perhaps roller skating to music, or matching music to a particular vibe. I also play a lot of Zelda games (haha, just kidding, I exclusively flip between Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom). Every now and again I boot up Minecraft, find a nice flower field, build a simple house, a little garden and some kind of aquatic infastructure and never go back onto that save. Stardew Valley is the last video game I'm adept in, but ever since I 100% complteted my 600 hour farm I haven't found much motivation to boot it up again.
        So yeah. As I continue to document my gameplay, work, and thoughts, you will be able to find bits and pieces of everything mentioned as you peruse this website.
